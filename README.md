# Dash0 Kubernetes Operator

The Dash0 Kubernetes Operator makes observability easy for every Kubernetes setup.
Simply install the operator into your cluster to get OpenTelemetry data flowing from your applications and
infrastructure to Dash0.

## Description

ingress endpoint, with authentication already configured out of the box. Additionally, it will enable gathering
OpenTelemetry data from applications deployed to the cluster for a selection of supported runtimes.

The Dash0 Kubernetes operator is currently in beta.

Supported runtimes:
